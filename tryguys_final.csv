Tune in twice a week for shows from Keith, Ned, Zach and Eugene, the creators and stars of The Try Guys.  FEATURING Uyen Kirshenbaum Michelin Starred Pastry Chef Find her work on Instagram: @kirshbakingco  RECIPE INGREDIENTS  4 egg whites  1 cup granulated sugar   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  or apple cider vinegar, to   stabilize  3 tangerines  2 navel oranges  1 ruby red grapefruit  1½ cups whipped cream (store bought or homemade, see   page xxx)  1 tablespoon honey  A handful of fresh basil or mint,  to serve   1. Preheat the oven to 250°F.  2. In a large bowl, use a stand mixer or a hand mixer on high speed  to beat eggs until frothy, being careful not to over mix, you don’t  want it to look grainy. Add the sugar and lemon juice slowly,  1 tablespoon of sugar at a time, and continue to beat until it forms  stiff peaks. Test it by pulling the whisk quickly up from the bowl  and looking for a pointy, glossy top.  3. Spoon the beaten egg whites onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Use a spoon or soft spatula to spread into a rough circle 9 inches  in diameter. Bake until firm, about 1 hour. Allow to cool to room  temperature in the oven with the door open.  4. Prepare the citrus by cutting off the rind and white pith so you  can see the citrus flesh. Slice each fruit into ¼-inch-thick rounds.   5. To serve, transfer the cooled pavlova to a platter. Spread the  whipped cream on top, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge.  Arrange the citrus slices, drizzling with honey and garnishing with  fresh basil or mint.   TIP: The meringue can be  made ahead of time and   stored for up to 2 days.

Shortly after my baby Wes was born, he got sent to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). It completely tore me apart.   I have been trying to figure out how I want to tell this story for weeks. I kept recutting this video, reliving the emotions. It has been hard.   But it's a story I want to share. I hope that it makes others who have been through or are currently going through similar experiences feel less alone. I hope that it inspires you personally, and fills you with hope that life, despite its challenges, after all, can be beautiful.  -Ned   P.S. A HUGE thank you to all of the nurses, doctors, and administrators at the NICU and all hospitals. We appreciate you so so much.
